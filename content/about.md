Hi there! I'm Rishabh Singhal, a software engineer at Rubrik with a deep passion for distributed systems, algorithms, and problem-solving. My journey in technology started with a curious mind that always sought patterns and mathematical beauty in everything around me.

From visualizing the centroid of birds flying in the sky to diving deep into distributed systems, my love for patterns and problem-solving has been a constant companion. I completed my B.Tech + MS in Computer Science and Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad, where I not only honed my technical skills but also explored various other interests ranging from psychology to philosophy.

This blog serves as my digital garden where I share my thoughts, learnings, and experiences in technology and beyond. You'll find posts about distributed systems, competitive programming, and occasional musings about life and learning.

## Technical Journey
Currently working at Rubrik, I focus on building robust distributed systems. My competitive programming background has shaped my approach to problem-solving and system design.
